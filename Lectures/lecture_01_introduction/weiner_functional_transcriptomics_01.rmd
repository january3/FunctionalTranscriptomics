## Organisatory matters

 * Course materials repository: [https://github.com/january3/FunctionalTranscriptomics](https://github.com/january3/FunctionalTranscriptomics)

--

 * Direct access to lectures (HTML): [https://january3.github.io/FunctionalTranscriptomics/](https://january3.github.io/FunctionalTranscriptomics/)

--

 * Getting credit for this course: you will have to send me a reproducible
   analysis (Rmarkdown or Jupyter notebook or a similar system) and the
   corresponding analysis files (not PDF or HTML!). I will have to be able
   to run it / view it. You will receive the homework during the second
   Workshop session and you will have two weeks to complete it. 

--

It won't be hard.


--

 * Please ask questions.

 * **Please do *ask* questions.**

## What this course is about

 * Functional analyses in transcriptomics
 * Reproducibility in science
    * Using R to take care of a *small bit* of a larger issue
 * Jump-starting on R/Rstudio

## Reasons for the reproducibility crisis: Lack of transparcency

"*We requested just the images of western blotting membranes and I wonder
how such images can contain novel information that is worth being kept
confidential.*"

## Reasons for the reproducibility crisis: Lack of transparcency

 * no precise description of methods:

```
We used generalized linear models (R package nlme4) to test the
significance of association.
```

Fine, but how exactly was the model formulated? How many covariates? What
transformations? What data were used? Which function? Were the results
corrected for multiple testing? Etc., etc., etc.

## What you will learn here and how that will help

.pull-left[
![](images/Rlogo.svg)
]

.pull-right[

 * Functional analysis of transcriptomic data

 * Writing reproducible and communicative analyses

 * Using markdown for your everyday needs
 
 * Tools for transparent and reproducible research (git, github, pipelines, containers)

 * Get a jump start on R – which makes reproducible research much easier
   and is a great statistical analysis language

]


---

## Why learn reproducible science with R?

 * Easy to document your statistical procedures

--

 * Fast lane from data to publication

--

 * Even if you barely use R, Rstudio is a great interface for editing
   (R)markdown files and github.

--

 * Harder to hide harking, p-hacking and file drawer

--

 * You can use it with Python, too

--

 * One way or the other, you will have to learn it or something similar

---

## Alternative: Jupyter Notebook

 * Python-oriented, but you can also use it with R

 * I find it harder to set up and use

 * No git interface

 * Not really an IDE (integrated development environment)

 * Less statistical analysis oriented, more flexible

---

## Why learn R?

.pull-left[

#### Pro

 * Massive amount of tools for statistics and specifically bioinformatics

 * Easy to get help

 * Even if you use Python, you will have to learn R (or you will work much
   more efficiently if you know R)

 * Nice if you like functional languages

 * R shiny allows creating server-based interactive apps

 * Learning statistics is *way* harder than learning R


]

--

.pull-right[

#### Con

 * Messy, bottom-up development with many quirks and inconsistencies

 * Many "dialects" (base R, tidyverse, Bioconductor...)

 * Functional languages are not intuitive if you come from a different
   programming background

]

---

## Python vs R

.pull-left[


### Python

 * flexible
 * general programming language
 * deep learning algorithms
 * you can use R from Python

]

.pull-right[

### R
 
 * statistics
 * data visualizations
 * interactive data exploration
 * you can use Python from R

]

--

**You probably will have to learn both, at least the basics.**

    * Vectors
    * Matrices / Arrays
