--

 * Direct access to lectures (HTML): [https://january3.github.io/FunctionalTranscriptomics/](https://january3.github.io/FunctionalTranscriptomics/)

--

 * Getting credit for this course: you will have to send me a reproducible

   corresponding analysis files (not PDF or HTML!). I will have to be able
   to run it / view it. You will receive the homework during the second
   Workshop session and you will have two weeks to complete it. 

--

It won't be hard.


--

 * Please ask questions.

--

 * **Please do *ask* questions.**

## What this course is about

 * Functional analyses in transcriptomics
 * Reproducibility in science
    * Using R to take care of a *small bit* of a larger issue

## Reasons for the reproducibility crisis: Lack of transparcency

how such images can contain novel information that is worth being kept
confidential.*"

## Reasons for the reproducibility crisis: Lack of transparcency

 * no precise description of methods:

```
We used generalized linear models (R package nlme4) to test the
significance of association.
```

Fine, but how exactly was the model formulated? How many covariates? What
transformations? What data were used? Which function? Were the results
corrected for multiple testing? Etc., etc., etc.

## What you will learn here and how that will help

.pull-left[
![](images/Rlogo.svg)
]

.pull-right[

 * Functional analysis of transcriptomic data

 * Writing reproducible and communicative analyses

 * Using markdown for your everyday needs
 
 * Tools for transparent and reproducible research (git, github, pipelines, containers)

 * Get a jump start on R – which makes reproducible research much easier
   and is a great statistical analysis language

]


---

## Why learn reproducible science with R?

 * Easy to document your statistical procedures

--

 * Fast lane from data to publication

--

 * Even if you barely use R, Rstudio is a great interface for editing
   (R)markdown files and github.

--

 * Harder to hide harking, p-hacking and file drawer

--

 * You can use it with Python, too

--

 * One way or the other, you will have to learn it or something similar

---

## Alternative: Jupyter Notebook

 * Python-oriented, but you can also use it with R

 * I find it harder to set up and use

 * No git interface

 * Not really an IDE (integrated development environment)

 * Less statistical analysis oriented, more flexible

---

## Why learn R?

.pull-left[

#### Pro

 * Massive amount of tools for statistics and specifically bioinformatics

 * Easy to get help

 * Even if you use Python, you will have to learn R (or you will work much
   more efficiently if you know R)

 * Nice if you like functional languages

 * R shiny allows creating server-based interactive apps

 * Learning statistics is *way* harder than learning R


]

--

.pull-right[

#### Con

 * Messy, bottom-up development with many quirks and inconsistencies

 * Many "dialects" (base R, tidyverse, Bioconductor...)

 * Functional languages are not intuitive if you come from a different
   programming background

]

---

## Python vs R

.pull-left[


### Python

 * flexible
 * general programming language
 * deep learning algorithms
 * you can use R from Python

]

.pull-right[

### R
 
 * statistics
 * data visualizations
 * interactive data exploration
 * low overhead for quick tasks
 * you can use Python from R

]

--

**You probably will have to learn both, at least the basics.**

#### The R language

 * Interpreted language
 * Functional language: everything is a function
 * Vectorization
 * Pass by value 
 * Lazy evaluation
 * Object oriented
 * Four main types of objects:
    * Vectors
    * Matrices / Arrays
    * Lists
    * Functions

]

--

.pull-right[

#### Functional language features:

 * Minimization of side effects
 * Closures (anonymous functions, like lambda in Python)
 * Vectorization: 
   * operating on vectors rather than scalars
   * Apply / map instead of loops

]

---

## Introduction to R

 * Return to the workshop 1/1 file.
 * Proceed until the end of the "R language basis" section.

## Literate programming


.pull-left[

*I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation
of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering
programs to be works of literature. Hence, my title: “Literate
Programming.”*

*Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to
human beings what we want a computer to do.*

## Coding for others (including yourself)

 * the "future you" will need to understand your analysis. You think you will
   remember, but you won't.

--

 * Principles of reproducibility require that your analysis is readable by
   other humans, not only by machines

--

 * Clear, well documented and communicative analysis will be also easier to
   maintain in future

---
 
## Literate programming

*The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an
essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of
style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, **chooses the names of
variables carefully and explains what each variable means**.*

--

*He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts
have been introduced in **an order that is best for human understanding**,
using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other.*

(Donald E. Knuth)

## Introduction to (R)markdown

 * Proceed with the workshop 1/1 file until the end.
