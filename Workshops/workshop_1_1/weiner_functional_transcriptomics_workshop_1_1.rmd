# First steps in R/Rstudio

## Workspaces

 Workspace is basically a folder which contains a few special files in
 which R stores project-specific data.

  * `Rhistory` (hidden file) – a text file containing all commands that you
    have issued
  * `Rdata` (hidden file) – a binary file containing your workspace (all
    objects created)
  * `<filename>.Rproj` – Rstudio R project file containing some
    rstudio-specific settings (text file)
  * Anything else should be saved by you


**Exercise.**

  * Start R studio $\rightarrow$ File $\rightarrow$ New project
    $\rightarrow$ New directory $\rightarrow$ New project and create a new
    project.
  * Examine the Files pane (lower right); what does it indicate?
  * Try to open the ".Rproj" file in a text editor. 
  * Go to File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ R Script
    to create a new R script.
  * In the new file, write a simple R statement, for example:

```
a <- 1:10
```

   * Press Ctrl/Cmd-Enter. 
   * What happens? What do you see in the console? 
   * What do you see under "Environment" on the top right?

## Using R as a git[hub] interface

If you want to download all lecture materials and update it easily when new
lectures come in, do the following:

  * Start R studio $\rightarrow$ File $\rightarrow$ New project
    $\rightarrow$ Version Control $\rightarrow$ Git 
  * Enter `https://github.com/january3/ReproducibleR2021` as the
    "Repository URL"
  * Pay attention to the "Create project as subdirectory of" entry field,
    so that you know where you are saving the project.
  * Click "Create Project". Rstudio will download all available materials.
  * When you want to update / check for updates, go to the "git" tab in the
    top right panel and press the blueish "down" arrow.

# R language basics

## R language basics

 * Assignment and variables (`a <- 2`)
 * vectors and multiple assignment (`a <- c(1, 7, 9)`)
 * operators (`3 + 5` or `a + 7`)
 * functions (`sum(c(1, 2, 3))`)

## Basic R data types

 * character values ("strings") – use double or single quotes
 * integer
 * numeric (doubles)
 * logical (TRUE / FALSE)
 * factor (with levels) – important for statistics
 * complex numbers
 * functions

**Exercise.**

 * create variables: a string, a number, a factor
   * how to create the variables?
   * how to view the variables?
 * what does `1:5` return?
 * what does `c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` return?


## R data structures

### vectors (character, integer, numeric, logical, factor)

 * constructing: with `c` (combine values): `c(1, 2, 5)`
 * accessing elements: `myvector[1]`, `myvector[c(1, 2, 5)]`
 * can be named with `names(myvector) <- c("A", "B", "C")`
 * there is no such thing as a scalar (single value), only a vector of
   length 1

### Matrices and arrays

 * matrix (character, integer, numeric, logical, factor)

 * constructing with `matrix()`, e.g.

     matrix(rnorm(100), ncol=10, byrow=TRUE)

 * accessing elements with `mtx[ row, column ]`
 * accessing by row and column: `mtx[ row, ]`, `mtx[ , column ]`
   $\rightarrow$ returns a vector (!)

### Lists

 Lists: can hold multiple types, can be named

 * Constructing: with `list()`, eg.

    list(a=1, b="test")

 * elements may have different class ("data type")
 * accessing elements:

    * by number, e.g. `mylist[[1]]`

    * by name (if defined), e.g. `mylist[["element name"]]`

    * using the `$` shortcut: `mylist$some_name`


### Data frames 

data frames (and such like): special type of lists

 * Constructing with `data.frame`, e.g.

     data.frame(ID=c("A", "B"), value=c(1, 2))

 * columns are elements of a list and can be accessed exactly like elements of a
   list (using `[[`, `$`)
 * in addition, matrix-style `[` operator (row/columns) is defined, but: warning! it
   works slightly differently! (ie `df[ row, ]`  does not return a row, but a data
   frame with one row)
 * There are many classes that extend the behavior of default data frames
   (tibble, DFrame, DT, colorDF, ...)

**Exercise.**

 * Use the `matrix` function to create a matrix with 5 rows and 2 columns,
   filled with random numbers (use `rnorm` to generate random numbers).
 * convert the matrix to a data frame using the `as.data.frame` function
 * Add a column with identifiers – first five letters of the alphabet (you
   can use the predefined vector `LETTERS` for it)
 * convert the data frame back to the matrix with `data.matrix`. 
 * What is the value type of the new matrix? (use `class` for this)

### Functions

Functions are also objects that can be either used in place (like any
value, say `5` or `"Berlin"`) or assigned to variables. This is important
for vectorization (lambda calculus).

 * Construction: using the `function` keyword:
       
      a <- function(i, j=5) {
         res <- i + j
         return(res)
      }
 * The variable `a` holds now the function object. You can assign the
   object (copy it) to another variable. Assignment is always by value,
   never by reference.

## Vectorization

Vectorization is an enormously important feature of languages such as R or
matlab. It allows natural and efficient computations.

### Simple vectorization

**Exercise.**

 * what happens when you add a number to a vector? (i.e. `c(3, 1, 4) + 5`)
 * what happens when you multiply a vector with a number?
 * what happens when you add two vectors?

**Exercise.**

  Try the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
vec1 <- 1:10
vec2 <- 20:30

vec1 + vec2
```

This returns a warning. Why? What is the problem?

### Vectorization with mapping functions

In R, instead of running code in a loop, we apply a function to all
elements of an object (list, vector, columns of a data frame or matrix).
This is a very important feature of the language. While the same might be
achieved in other languages (e.g. lambda calculus in Python), in R it is
very natural and simple. Loops are used very rarely in mature R code.

#### Example: calculating 100 random distributions 

**Task:** Generate 100 vectors, each with 10 random numbers. For each
vector, calculate the mean and SD. Keep the vectors.

**Example using loops:**

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
samples <- list()
means   <- c()
sds     <- c()
for(i in 1:100) {
  samples[i] <- rnorm(10, mean=1, sd=2)
  means[i]   <- mean(samples[i])
  sds[i]     <- sd(samples[i])
}
```

**The R way:**

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
samples <- replicate(100, rnorm(10, mean=1, sd=2))
means   <- sapply(samples, mean)
sds     <- sapply(samples, sd)
```

(note: `lapply` returns always a list, `sapply` returns whatever the hell
it thinks it should. Better functions in `tidyverse`)

**Exercise:** basic use of sapply and lapply

 1. Use `sample` to generate a vector of length 150 containing random
    numbers from 20 to 500.
 2. Apply the `lapply` function to the vector from (1.) to generate 50
    vectors, each of a random length from 20 to 500.
 3. Apply the `sapply` function to the result of (2.) to calculate the
    means and SD's of the 150 vectors.
 4. Use `plot(x, y)` function to plot the means vs vector length (x should
    be the vector from (1.), and y should be the result from (3))

## Installing packages

There are three main sources of R packages in bioinformatics: CRAN,
Bioconductor and github.

### Installing packages from CRAN

Install the packages "tmod", "ggplot2" and "BiocManager" using following
commands:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tmod")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("BiocManager")
```

### Installing packages from Bioconductor

```{r eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```

### Installing packages from github

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("january3/colorDF")
```

# (R)markdown

## Using (R) markdown with Rstudio

### Opening an Rmarkdown file

First, we will take a look at Rmarkdown.

 1. Go to `File` $\rightarrow$ `New File` $\rightarrow$ `R Markdown`.
    Select `Document`, fill out the "title", use HTML.
 2. Take a closer look at the file. Where does the title you entered
    appear?  
 3. Save file to your project directory (`Ctrl-S`).
 4. Knit your markdown: press `Ctrl-Shift-K` or click on the ball of yarn.
 5. Compare the output to the document.

### Working with markdown – basic formatting

 1. Try out the following: creating **bold** (`**bold**`), *italics*
    (`*italics*`)
 2. Make a footnote:

            Text with a footnote^[This is the footnote.].

 3. Download an image to your working directory. Insert it into the
    rmarkdown document:

          ![Image caption](image_file_name.jpg)

 4. Create a bullet point and numbered list. What happens if you use
     different numbers or change the order of the numbers?

```
 * one
 * two 
 * three

 1. one
 2. two
 3. three
```

 4. Create a simple table, like this:

```
  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1
```

### Working with chunks

There are fragments of R code in the document which get compiled to
markdown. These are called *chunks*.

 1. What happens when your remove the `{r...}` fragment from the chunk
    starting marking?
 2. Click on the green triangle (<span style="color:green;">▶</span>). What
    happens?
 3. Click on the cogwheel (⚙) symbol. What options do you see? Try them.



## Exercise: Example Rmarkdown analysis

There is a lake in a garden. Every day, the water lilies cover twice as
much area as the previous day. On the first day, the water lilies cover
1/100th of the area of the lake.

 * What is the formula to calculate the area covered by the water lilies on
   day n? (pen and paper, not in Rstudio!)
 * Open a new Rmarkdown document and create your analysis as follows.
 * assign days 1 ... 10 to variable x. Now assign the fraction of the area
   covered by water lilies on day n to variable y
 * plot x vs y (use the simple `plot(x, y)` function)
 * When will the half of the area be covered by water lilies? Use `abline(h=.5)`
   (what does it do?) to show a graphical solution
 * What is the fraction on day 3? Hint: what does `y[3]` do?
 * Speaking of which, what dows `y[4:5]` do? (just try it!)
 * Make the plot yourself.
 * use 'col' parameter of `plot` and a color name (e.g. "red") to change
   the color of the line (`plot(..., col="red")`)
 * what if each day the lilies cover a fraction of area that is 1.5 the
   fraction of area on the previous day?
 * Use `lines(x, y)` function to put a second line on the plot
